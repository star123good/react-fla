> **Contribution disclaimer:** Flatris is a web game with an opinionated feature set and architectural design. It doesn't have a roadmap. While I'm generally open to ideas, I would advise against submitting unannounced PRs with new or modified functionality. That said, **bug reports and fixes are most appreciated.**
